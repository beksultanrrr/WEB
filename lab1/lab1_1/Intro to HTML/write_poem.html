    <h1> Bluebird </h1>
    <p> there's a bluebird in my heart that <br>
        wants to get out <br>
        but I'm too tough for him,<br>
        I say, stay in there, I'm not going <br>
        to let anybody see <br>
        you. <br>
        there's a bluebird in my heart that <br>
        wants to get out <br>
        but I pour whiskey on him and inhale <br>
        cigarette smoke <br>
        and the whores and the bartenders <br>
        and the grocery clerks <br>
        never know that <br>
        he's <br>
        in there.</p>
