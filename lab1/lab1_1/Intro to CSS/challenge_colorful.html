        <p> <em> Ladybug </em> (lat. Coccinellidae) belongs to the family of beetles, a type of arthropods, a class of insects. <strong> At the sight of an insect, a person involuntarily has a reaction â€“ to swat it as soon as possible </strong>, but the ladybug is sympathetic to almost everyone, even <em> women </em>. Some recall a children's song associated with her, others recall that she helps them out a lot at the dacha - saves the garden from pests.
